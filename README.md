   - Once you've done this, there are only a few things left to do...

  3. Add our modules (libraries) to the project.
    - we added just one module (called "graphics") from an outside source. 
    - to install it, we need to go to this screen: 
   
   - ![PyCharm_Plugin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47507330/135581107-802069d9-2265-4685-917a-4200315f54b9.png)
    
   - then click that '+' towards the top of that screen and search for "graphics"
   - ![Screen Shot 2021-10-01 at 3 21 06 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47507330/135581233-0e9b4ed6-e635-4cda-8d03-5d2f17ca9d81.png)
   
   - You should see a "graphics.py" module. simply click on it and click "install package" at the bottom
  
  4. Running code in PyCharm
    - After we have done all of this, our last step is to just run our code! This is very simple.

   - we just right-click on our "main.py" and press "play".
   - That should run it. after that, we're done!
